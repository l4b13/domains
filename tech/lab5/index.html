                            Armed with his Peacekeeper revolver, the outlaw Jesse McCree doles out justice on his own terms.

                        <p>
                            McCree had already made a name for himself as a member of the notorious Deadlock Gang, which trafficked in illicit weapons and military hardware throughout the American Southwest, when he and his associates were busted in an Overwatch sting operation. With his expert marksmanship and resourcefulness, he was given the choice between rotting in a maximum-security lockup and joining Blackwatch, Overwatch's covert ops division. He chose the latter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although he was initially cynical, he came to believe that he could make amends for his past sins by righting the injustices of the world. McCree appreciated the flexibility afforded to the clandestine Blackwatch, unhindered by bureaucracy and red tape. But as Overwatch's influence waned, rogue elements within Blackwatch sought to bring down the organization and turn it to their own ends. Wanting no part of the infighting, McCree set off alone and went underground.

                        <p>
                            He resurfaced several years later as a gunslinger for hire. But while McCree's talents are sought after by parties great and small, he fights only for causes he believes are just.

                            Mccree is a young man with tan skin and shoulder-length brown hair. He wears a dirty brown cowboy hat, a tan shirt with silver armor on top, brown pants, dark cowboy boots, gloves, and a tattered red shawl. McCree also has a left prosthetic arm.

                            In Overwatch 2, McCree appears to have more lighter skin, short hair, a longer beard, and a clean red shawl. He maintains his cowboy hat and prosthetic arm, both now more detailed.

                            McCree is a calm man, rarely showing intense emotions with an element of carefreeness. Although he was once an outlaw, he is always looking to do the right thing, trying to atone for his past. He often acts polite and respectful towards both his team and strangers but can be cocky at times. He is also appreciative of weapons and prefers for them to be treated with care, as verified by his dialogue with Reaper. Additionally, McCree seems to be pretty charming, evidenced by his brief conversation with Ana before a match starts.

                            Fancying himself as a justice bringing cowboy and having an appearance to match, McCree usually makes multiple references to Western films and culture, as shown by his voice lines and quotes during battle. He also seems to joke about himself being wanted dead by multiple groups, according to his reaction to seeing his picture on a dartboard in Route 66. McCree also tends to be a bit sassy, as heard in his dialogue during Retribution.
